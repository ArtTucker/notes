#Angular 101

##Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson you should be able to...

* Approach a new technology with the proper intent
* Compare and contrast Angular to jQuery
* Implement two-way data binding
* Setup a controller and use $scope to share data with your view
* Display all your data and add a filter

___

##Please Know...

1) Your perceptions are probably wrong, so don't psych yourselves out

2) The learning never, ever stops

3) Slow and Steady wins the race

4) The reward is proportional to the effort

5) Most do not make it this far

6) A new technology opens doors

##Angular vs jQuery


###jQuery
* Based on **declarative** statements to render dynamic data on the DOM
	* SQL is similar in that it explicitly declares exact instructions for the database to execute
	* Declarative statement: "Enter GA turn right, walk 25 steps, turn right, walk 3 steps, turn left, open the door"
* It heavily enforces **configuration**
	* Just like Express or Sinatra
	
###Angular

* Based on **imperative** statements to render dynamic data on the DOM
	* Think of Active Record (or any ORM) that can infer what SQL to write for you
	* Imperative statement: "Meet me in classroom 4"
* It heavily enforces **convention**
	* Just like Rails

##How Angular Fits into What We Know


* Angular is for building **front-end** applications
* It is a framework
* It allows us to dictate both the data's behavior and its presentation together
* Optionally, if you want to persist & share data, Angular must communicate with an API hooked into a database (Rails works well for this)

####Basic Angular Components
* Directives
* Controllers
* Scopes
* Dependency Injection
* Services (we will discuss this in next lesson)

##Simple App


Let's investigate this simple Angular [app](http://jsbin.com/saduxiquju/2/)

* The input field updates the ng-model it is registered with
* The each time the ng-model is updated it immediately re-renders a section of the DOM
* In Angular this instantaneous, reactive behavior is known as **2-Way Data Binding**

####DIRECTIVES

* A directive is a marker on a HTML tag that tells Angular to run or reference it's internal JavaScript code, i.e. `ng-model`
* There are many preset ones which we will explore together
* Additionally you can create custom ones, which we will cover in the next lesson

---

##Now You Try


Head to [JSbin](http://jsbin.com/) and replicate this app using:

* ng-app
* ng-model=“yourName”
* {{ yourName }}

*Don't forget to include angular in your `<head>`*

Definitely refer to the [Angular docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide) as much as possible.

##Controllers & Scope
* A controller in Angular is similar to one in Rails; it houses the logic of your app
* For example you could...
	* Get data from an API
	* Define functions
* A new controller also creates a new scope; we write as `$scope`
* `$rootScope` is Angular's global scope outside of a controller
* You can think using `$scope` in Angular controllers like you think about `@` in Rails controllers

##Let's Create a Controller

* I want to create a controller that has a default value name
* First we need an app that we can house in a [module](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module); modules are the most basic container for code

```
angular.module("myApp", [])
```
* Now controllers can be chained on to your app object

```
.controller('HomeCtrl', function($scope){
	$scope.user = {
		name: 'Theodore'
	};
	$scope.speech = {
		title: 'The Way of the Bull Moose'
	};
});
``` 
___

##ng-repeat

Here is an example of a very commonly used directive, `ng-repeat`

```
.controller('HomeCtrl', function($scope){
	$scope.users = [
		{
			name: 'Theodore Roosevelt',
			activity: 'hiking'
		},				
		{
			name: 'John Fitzgerald Kennedy'
			activity: 'reading'
		},
		{
			name: 'Thomas Jefferson',
			activity: 'teaching'
		}
	];
});
```

```
<body>
  <div ng-controller="HomeCtrl">
    <ul ng-repeat="president in presidents">
      <li>Vote for: {{president.name}}</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</body>
```

##Dependency Injection

[Dependency Injection](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di) is one of the strangest sides of Angular... Hopefully if you understand why we do this, it will make more sense.

* At it's essence all it is, is passing a function arguments
*
